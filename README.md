# <strong>[Project Name]</strong> - Plants Disease Detection & Solution Recommendation

### <em>Overview</em>
The <strong>[Project Name]</strong> is an automated web application designed to detect plant diseases from images and recommend appropriate solutions. This multi-class classification model identifies specific diseases from a set of twelve categories. Once the disease is detected, the system provides a solution from a pre-defined database. The project is highly beneficial for early crop disease detection and for offering timely solutions to ensure the health of crops.

### <em>Features</em>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Disease Detection</strong>: Detects plant diseases from images using deep learning models.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution Recommendation</strong>: Provides specific solutions for the detected disease from a database.</li>
    <li><strong>Flask Web Application</strong>: Real-time interaction via a Flask web interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Model</strong>: Utilizes pre-trained AlexNet and ResNet50 models for accurate disease classification.</li>
</ul>

### <strong>Running the Project Locally</strong>

1. <strong>Training the Model</strong><br>
   - Download the dataset and run the provided Jupyter Notebook to train the AlexNet and ResNet50 models. The models will be saved after training.
   - You can modify the number of epochs in the notebook as needed.

2. <strong>Run the Flask App</strong><br>
   After the models are trained, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run the following command:
   <pre><code>python app.py</code></pre>
   This will start the Flask server, and the web application will be available in your browser.

3. <strong>Access the Web Application</strong><br>
   Open the provided Flask interface link in your browser. You can upload an image of a plant, and the system will return a prediction of the disease along with a recommended solution.
